# You're fed up about changing the version of your software manually. Instead, you will create a little script that
# will make it for you.
# You will be given a version as in this example: "1.3.4". You have to find the next version
# and print it ("1.3.5" from the example). The only rule is that the numbers cannot be greater than 9.
# If that happens, set the current number to 0 and increase the number before it. For more clarification, see
# the examples. Note: there will be no case where the first number will get greater than 9
